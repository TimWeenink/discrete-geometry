1/12 : Analyse of the problem and reading the wikipidea pages
2/12 : Start of implementation, where the matrix and the vector are given
			Code very slow for 'big' matrix like A6 but works for small ones even H3
3/12 : Implementation of the matrix, start of the case where the vector is not give
			Try to generate all the hyperplanes to check that the random vector is not 
			on them, which makes the code even slower
4/12 : End of the case where the vector is not given
5/12 : Cleaning code and adding the mesure of time.
9/12 : Change list by tuple, and adapting the code, makes the code faster but I can not calculate if two vector are 	equal up to a tolerance anymore
10-11/12 : Trying to find a solution for case like H3, H4 where there are irrational number


Test made : 
The code works for A with n<7, but starts to get slow for n = 7, and so I didn't test n>7
				   D with n<6, but starts to get slow, again for question of time I didn't test n>6
				   H3 but not for H4 due to the rounding errors and long numbers
				   F4
I didn't test E8 for a question of time.
