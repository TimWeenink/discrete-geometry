28/11/2014	Reading theory
29/11/2014 	Implementing the firsts functions (A_n, D_n, vector_not_in_hyperplanes...)
30/11/2014 	Implemented the "ref" (vector_reflection) function. Tested with A_n and D_n. Problems with the order of A_n.
01/12/2014	Implemented "vector_not_in_hyperplanes"
02/12/2014 	Fixed "vector_not_in_hyperplanes" (it didn't check all the reflecting hyperplanes). 
	  	Function "v_orbit_cardinality" written. Also, F_4 and E_8 functions defined.
03/12/2013	Splited cases in "v_orbit_cadinality". Problems with A_n fixed. Intent to implement $H$. 
04/12/2013	Intent to implement $H$. We should consider \sqrt(5) in an exact way and also implement its orbit...
